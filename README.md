# DOT NET MVC Single Page Application
### Project Introduction:
Here we are require to build a web page to add, edit, delete, list, and search for products. We will be building this page using MVC 5, but we donâ€™t want to use the five separate pages generated from the Visual Studio 2015 scaffolding engine. Instead we will combine all those pages together in a "SPA"-like technique. We also want to take advantage of MVVM so we can reuse all data access and validation in a mobile application that may require in the future. 
So this project is a demo to show how to use all of these tools to accomplish SPA-like technique in MVC applications and improve testability and reusability.
